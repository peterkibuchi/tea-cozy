## General Information
- This website is based on the following [design spec](./assets/img/img-tea-cozy-redline-design-spec.jpg).
- I undertook this project as a means of learning the principles of Responsive Web Design.
- I learnt a lot about using flexbox and media queries in particular.


## Technologies Used
- HTML & CSS


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_.


## Room for Improvement
- Improve the visual design.
- I feel the CSS is too clunky and cluttered. I'd like to refactor it to be more readable, concise and elegant.
